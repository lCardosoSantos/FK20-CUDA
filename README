# FK20 project


## Luan's todolist
Here in this section I keep track of the activities I am working on. Meaningful indentation
Last update: 20230711

- Improvements in the code base:
  - [ ]  Implement a CRC check on the KAT data before and after every test.
  - [ ]  Benchmark: Implement a separate benchmark with GPU spool-up.
  - [ ]  512row: Move KATs to a dinamic lib
  - [x]  ~~Test 512row with prefiled memory patterns~~ 20230706: no new test failures.
- Debug:
  - [ ] g1p_mul ispoint test works as expected?
  - [ ] fk20_hext_fft2h_fft: hext_fft -> h_fft: breaks after the math update, tmp-reg is zerod (?)
  - [ ] g1p inverted fft doesnt pass tests (Dag here) ~~(but ift(fft(x))=>x)~~
    - [ ] Remove shared memory from fft?
  - [x] ~~Fix of g1pComparen with Null non-point parameter~~ 20230710: Come back here for more robust solution
  - [ ] >>>> fk20_poly2h_fft_515 (full fk20 execution, currently host)
    - [x] ~~cuda error 700~~ 20230707
    - [ ] Error with memory pattern on tmp variables. *Only on g1p*
  - [ ] fk20_poly2hext_fft_512: 
    - [x] ~~cuda error 700~~
    - [ ] Fails KAT. Compare memory dumps of two blocks with same KAT?
    - ~~note: Check with DA/DF if all the rows being fk20 over the same setup is an actual characteristic of the implementation. Will have impact on memory allocations if different setups.~~ By default, same setup across rows.
  - [ ] hext_fft2h_fft_512: cuda error 700
  - [ ] fk20_msmloop_512: cuda error 700
  - [ ] fk20_poly2toeplitz_coefficients_fft_512: cuda error 700
  - [x] ~~fk20_poly2toeplitz_coefficients_fft: unknown cuda error 700~~ 20230711
  - [x] ~~fk20_poly2toeplitz_coefficients_512: not passing test~~ 20230706
